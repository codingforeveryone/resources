# Regex resources and tutorials

There are many regex (or regular expression) resources available online. The following is a list of tutorials, regex testers, references and games recommended by the codingforeveryone community.

Lists are organised by popularity, based on user votes.

### Tutorials
- [RegexOne](http://regexone.com/) is a tutorial that starts simply and gets more complex. It's regex-only, JavaScript regex methods aren't covered
- [RexEgg](http://www.rexegg.com/) is the codewars of regex. It has tutorials that go from beginner through to advanced, and some language-specific material
- [JavaScript Tutorial: regular expressions in javascript](http://javascript.info/tutorial/regular-expressions-javascript), includes concepts not covered elsewhere, such as greedy & lazy quantifiers
- [Eloquent JavaScript, chapter 9](http://eloquentjavascript.net/09_regexp.html) is available online with interactive exercises (and hints)

###Regex testers
- [Regex101](https://regex101.com/) 
- [RegExr](http://regexr.com/)

### References
- [Regular-Expressions.info](http://www.regular-expressions.info/) is a good reference for more sophisticated expressions (not JavaScript specific)
- [CFE ReadMe: Regular Expressions - a Beginner's guide](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs/blob/master/JavaScript/regular-expressions-beginners-guide.md)
- [CFE ReadMe: Regular Expressions - Lookaheads](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs/blob/master/JavaScript/regular-expressions-lookaheads.md)

### Games
- [Regex Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com/) has its own tutorial as well as beginner, intermediate and advanced crosswords
- [Regex Golf](http://regex.alf.nu/) is quite addictive. Watch out!
- This blog has a single large [regular expression crossword puzzle](https://gregable.com/2015/12/regular-expression-crossword-puzzle.html) - not for the faint-hearted

### Codewars
Here are some recommended regEx codewars problems. These are good to start with because they don't have too many additional steps and their random tests won't trip you up.
Please add more good regEx tasks as and when you find them.
