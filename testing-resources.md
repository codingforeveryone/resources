#Testing Resources and Tutorials

Test driven development (TDD) means making tests that will ensure your programs do what you want, before you start to write any code.
TDD helps us write stable code, and ensures that we can make changes without breaking our codes existing functionality. 
It is also secretly what we are doing on Codewars!


### Test Driven Development
- [Agile Alliance Glossary](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/) Gives a more in depth explanation of Test Driven Development


### Making Tests for Codewars
- [Coding For Everyone - Write Your Own Kata](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs/blob/master/codewars/writing-your-own-kata.md) This includes a good guide to making tests for your Katas.
- [Coding For Everyone - Random Tests](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs/blob/master/codewars/random-test-cases-for-complete-beginners.md) How to expand your testing suite with random tests.
- [Conjured Codewars Codex - testing](https://bkaestner.github.io/codewars-rules/#tested-testing-theories) - What to do, and what not to do, when writing Codewars tests.
- [Codewars Documentation - Javascript testing reference] https://www.codewars.com/docs/js-slash-coffeescript-test-reference - Codewars documentation. A good reference, but still a little confusing without a bit of background knowledge of testing frameworks.

### General Tutorials
