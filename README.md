[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/resources](https://badges.gitter.im/codingforeveryone/resources.svg)](https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone/resources?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

A crowdsourced collection of links to our favourite learning resources.

###Instructions: How to add a resource link

First check the open issues to see whether a resource list has already been created for your topic. If so, add your link in a comment, allowing others to vote on it (remember to add just one resource per comment, so people can vote on one suggestion at a time).

If there is no topic covering your resource link, open an issue, announce it on gitter and let people post their own favourite links. 

To estabilish the most prefered resources, vote on other's comments.
